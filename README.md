# gRPC

This is a simple mockup application that I built during my internship to help me visualise and understand the basic concepts of gRPC.

In this exchange, a client can use a console based menu to send requests to a server. Clients have the option to "add a user" to the system, or the option to "list all users" within the system.

To get started, follow these steps:

- Run `go run server/server.go` to start the server
- In a separate terminal, run `go run client/client.go` to connect to the server
- Use the console menu to make requests to the server

# What I Learned

- Exposing functionality and communicating between services using gRPC.
